            <p>
              A Full Stack Software Engineer with over 2 years of professional
              experience in building comprehensive web applications. My focus
              lies in delivering robust software solutions to complex problems,
              particularly in challenging domains. I bring a creative approach
              to problem-solving and actively participate in technical
              discussions. My commitment to writing clean, maintainable, and
              scalable code ensures high-quality software development.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              I have expertise across a diverse set of technologies, including
              primary languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My
              experience spans various frameworks and libraries, including
              React, NextJS, Astro, and Angular. I am well-versed in working
              with databases like Oracle (PL/SQL), PostgreSQL, and MongoDB
              (NoSQL). My familiarity with the Software Development Life Cycle
              (SDLC) is supported by tools such as GitHub, Azure, Docker, and
              AWS, along with both REST and GraphQL APIs. My strong
              communication skills facilitate effective interaction with clients
              for requirement gathering and validation, designers for design
              requests and finalization, project managers and tech leads for
              requirement understanding and issue resolution, fellow software
              engineers for collaborative problem-solving, and interns for
              mentorship and guidance.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              I am currently shifting my focus towards WebGL and GSAP animation,
              while still exploring AI applications on the side. My interests
              lie in developing interactive and visually compelling web
              experiences using WebGL to create advanced graphics and
              animations. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of
              combining WebGL's powerful rendering capabilities with GSAP's
              robust animation library to produce seamless, high-performance
              animations.Additionally, I am keen on integrating AI techniques to
              enhance these animations, such as optimizing rendering processes
              or creating intelligent, adaptive visual elements. Tackling these
              challenges is crucial for developing innovative web solutions that
              bridge the gap between traditional web experiences and immersive,
              real-time graphics.
